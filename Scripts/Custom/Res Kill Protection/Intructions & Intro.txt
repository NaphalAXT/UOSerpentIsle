Anti RK system to prevent pvpers re-killing the same person over and over.
This package also comes with a toggle off command for players if they're granted immortal and they want to
remove it all they have to do is type [RK, you may change command in RKPOff.cs "RK", Let players know.



To Install:
*Copy RK Protect folder to your custom script's folder
*edit playermobile.cs in mobiles folder



in playermobile.cs search for: 
			if ( this.Alive && !wasAlive )




after the brace add:
				if ( this.AccessLevel < AccessLevel.GameMaster )
					new RKProtect( this, 60.0).Start();




it should look something like this:



		public override void Resurrect()
		{
			bool wasAlive = this.Alive;

			base.Resurrect();

			if ( this.Alive && !wasAlive )
			{
				if ( this.AccessLevel < AccessLevel.GameMaster )
					new RKProtect( this, 60.0).Start();

				Item deathRobe = new DeathRobe();

				if ( !EquipItem( deathRobe ) )
					deathRobe.Delete();
			}
		}

To modify timer/count down change 60.00 in line: new RKProtect( this, 60.0).Start();
60.00 is in seconds it's the count down for the immortal privilage you may change it to whatever you like.
